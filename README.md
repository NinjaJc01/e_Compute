# e_Compute
This project is a collection of ways to calculate, compute or guesstimate Euler's number, e.
Most of these use the Brother's summation, however one Python example notably uses a Poisson distribution, with lambda = 1 to calculate 1/e and then flips this fraction.
Programs are a mixture of my work and the work of collaborators. All of the Python is mine
